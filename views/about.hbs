    <b>Keeping Track of Your Things the Easy Way</b><br><br>

    <b>Goal of this Website:</b><br>
    This website aims to help people keep track of their items easily without having to write it down <br>
    in a piece of paper that might get lost. It is an inventory system that allows a user or multiple
    <br>
    users to look at or manage the inventory.
    <br><br>

    <b>How to Organize Your Things:</b><br>
    Start by creating your account. After having your account created, you can now start creating
    <br>
    inventories to put in the thing you want to keep track of. You can invite your friends, family,
    <br>
    co-workers to help you keep track and manage your inventory.
    <br><br>

        
    <b>Who Are We?</b><br>
    The developers of this website are a group of college students who needed to create a web 
    <br>
    application for a project. They chose to create this type of project, the inventory management 
    <br>
    system, because they think that it is important to know what you have and donâ€™t have. The team 
    <br>
    wanted to help people keep track of their things and thought that it would be a great idea to
    <br>
    have other people help each other out in managing their inventories.
